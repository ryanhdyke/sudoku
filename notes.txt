Where I left off: working on formatting the mode button

Major additions: add coloring tiles option
                 have a couple preset boards to choose from
                 add undo and redo buttons
                 have a mode to create a new puzzle

Small additions: make it so double click selects all similar tiles (by same main digit or color)
                 improve win box and end pop up
                 come up with a better way to detect out of bounds click for the number pad
                    shouldnt be by pixels
                 have a more dynamic and responsive page (especially numberpad)
                 improve the formatting for corner and center numbers 
                 have a better way to show the mode

Bugs: holding down mouse outside of the grid highlights the buttons and top text
      shift or ctrl and delete deletes all and not just corner or center marks







fix moving around with arrow keys to select (make it not be random and weird when multiple tiles are selected)
    when holding down ctrl, selects more tiles, with no ctrl, it just moves the selected tile over
    maybe add a global boolean variable if multiple tiles are selected at the same time
    maybe if multiple tiles are selected, moving around clears all of them and only adds the one from the new movement
        or have something to track the last selected tile and when multiple are selected and ctrl is held down, it selects from there

    have a global variable in board that tracks the last tile selected (null if no tile is selected),
    then moving when the ctrl key is down will move from there, selecting the new tiles and keeping the ones you go over selected,
    regardless of the number of tiles selected.
    without ctrl held down, it will just clear the entire board and move in the chosen direction


all movement/clicking on tiles cases

---------- clicking new cells ----------
all variables: single or multiple cells, holding ctrl or not, clicking selected tile vs non selected

single cell is selected and I click on it - it should unselect regardless of CTRL down or not
    works
any amount of cells are selected and I click outside of the grid - all cells should deselect
    works
any amount of cells are selected and I click on another cell without holding down CTRL - all the cells are deselected and the new one is selected
    works
any amount of cells are selected and I click on another cell while holding down CTRL - all the cells are still selected and the new one is also selected
    works
multiple cells are selected and I click on one of them without holding down CTRL - all cells except for the one I clicked on are deselected
    does not work. all cells are now deselected
multiple cells are selected and I click on one of them while holding down CTRL - all cells stay selected except for the one I clicked, which is deselected
    works

multiple cells are selected and I drag across one or more of them while holding down CTRL - all cells stay selected except for the ones I drag over, which is deselected
    does not work at all


BUG: if a tile is selected (any amount) and I drag to another tile without holding CTRL, it deselects without selecting more 

----------Cases for dragged--------------------------------------
nothing selected, drag will select all of the tiles dragged over
if clicking on a selected tile (any amount) and holding down CTRL, dragging will deselect all tiles dragged over
if clicking on a selected tile (any amount) without holding down CTRL, deselects all tiles except the one you clicked on and selects all
    tiles that are dragged over

---------- arrow key movement ----------
single cell is selected and I use an arrow key to move without holding down CTRL - the cell is deselected and the cell i move to is selected
single cell is selected and I use an arrow key to move while holding down CTRL - the cell is still selected and the cell i move to is selected

might want to start over for mouseClicked and mouseDragged. have a variable counting the number of tiles selected
and have cases to handle every type of scenario
